    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify the steps needed to use SQLAlchemy with a database\n",
    "    * Build the database using declarative_base class - Britta\n",
    "    * Define features such as id, name, etc, create a primary key and any other relationships - Brian/Britta\n",
    "    * Connect to the database with the engine - Britta\n",
    "    * Build it - Rafael\n",
    "    * Add in rows by using session_maker - Rafael\n",
    "    * add_all(), .new (gives us status update), .commit() commits the changes\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Understand and explain the concept of an Object Relational Mapper\n",
    "    * define overlapping classes (relational)\n",
    "    * we like ORMs so we can use OOP instead of SQL queries\n",
    "    * security purposes\n",
